# Topic : Kubeflow



[About kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/kubeflow/): 
The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, 
portable and scalable. Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy 
best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, 
you should be able to run Kubeflow

## Kubeflow component:
1. [Arena](https://github.com/kubeflow/arena)
Monitor and run distributed training job. Based on k8s and helm chart. 
To explore : Training with tensorboard: https://github.com/kubeflow/arena/blob/master/docs/userguide/2-tfjob-tensorboard.md 

2. [fairing](https://github.com/kubeflow/fairing)
Package to stream line training -> deploying

3. [pipeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines)
Different between airflow : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXPgX7G_eow&utm_campaign=Singapore&utm_content=97139107&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-381629790
 
 
4. [kfserving](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving)
high abstraction interfaces for common ML frameworks like Tensorflow, XGBoost, ScikitLearn, PyTorch, and ONNX.
Based on knative and istio. 

5. [katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib)
Katib is a Kubernetes-based system for Hyperparameter Tuning and Neural Architecture Search. Katib supports a number of ML frameworks, including TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch, XGBoost, and others

6. [mpioperator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator)
