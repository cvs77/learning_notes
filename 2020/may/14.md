## DevOps vs MlOps

### Team skills
The data scientist are lack of skills for building production-class services 

### Development 
ML development is in experimental nature. The challege is at tracking

### Testing
The testing for ML project is also involve data testing and data validation. 

### Deployment 
The deployment should often involve model validation with validation set, model retrain with a auto pipeline 

### Production
The model performance is related not just with app code but also data profile. Which certain data statistic summary 
involved. 

To Summary the differences, in MlOps
*  CI is not longer only about testing and validation the code, it is also about test and validate source data. 
*  CD CD is no longer about a single software package or a service, but a system (an ML training pipeline) that should automatically deploy another service (model prediction service).
*  CT is a new property, unique to ML systems, that's concerned with automatically retraining and serving the models.


Data science steps for ML

1. Data extraction 
2. Data analysis 
3. Data preparation 
4. Model training 
5. Model evaluation 
6. Model validation 
7. Model serving 
8. Model monitoring
