# Learning kustomize

Benefit of kustomize
1. It allow yamls files been shared and further customize by other in a very flesible manna. 
For example. the developer no need to leave all the customized value as {{ .Values.my_value }} in helm chart. 
2. It have more design for kubernetes context, but helm is more like to user go template as a template engine only. 
Kustomize template engine is aware of kubernetes context. 


## Adding values

```yaml
apiVersion: builtin
 kind: ValueAddTransformer
 metadata:
   name: dirNameAdd
 
 #  Omitting the 'value:' field means that the current
 #  kustomization root directory name will be used as
 #  the value.
 # value:  not specified!
 
 targets:
 - fieldPath: metadata/namespace
 - selector:
     kind: IAMPolicyMember
   fieldPath: spec/resourceRef/external
   filePathPosition: 2
```


## Config generation 
Config generation will help generate content hash of config map and make it a part of deployment. This will help 
re-deployment been trigger upon config context updates. 

```yaml
# declare ConfigMap from a ConfigMapGenerator
configMapGenerator:
- name: a-configmap
  files:
    # configfile is used as key
    - configs/configfile
    # configkey is used as key
    - configkey=configs/another_configfile

```


## Merge configs

```yaml
resources:
- ../../base
namePrefix: dev-
nameSuffix: -v1
configMapGenerator:
- name: my-configmap
  behavior: merge
  files:
  - plumbing.properties
  - secret.properties
```

## Generator option 
This is for control generator configuration. 


## Demo: Injecting k8s runtime data into containers

Use patch.yaml file like, the yaml file could help you load other 
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: init-command
        image: debian
        command:
        - "echo $(WORDPRESS_SERVICE)"
        - "echo $(MYSQL_SERVICE)"
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: $(MYSQL_SERVICE)
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
```



## Remote target

Kustomize can run from remote source as well. 

The remote source url must follow [go-getter url format](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format)
Refer from resource: 
```yaml
resources:
- github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/multibases?ref=v1.0.6
namePrefix: remote-
```

Build from remote:
```bash
target="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/multibases?ref=v1.0.6"
test 3 == \
  $(kustomize build $target | grep cluster-a-.*-myapp-pod | wc -l); \
  echo $?
```


## Json patch
Kustomize support json path syntax to further customize or update the resources. 
For more about json patch [Json Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)

For example, this ingress yaml file
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: homepage
          servicePort: 8888
      - path: /api
        backend:
          serviceName: my-api
          servicePort: 7701
      - path: /test
        backend:
          serviceName: hello
          servicePort: 7702
```
we want to :
* change the value of host to foo.bar.io
* change the port for '/' from 8888 to 80
*  insert an entirely new serving path /healthz at a particular point in the paths list, rather than at the end or the beginning.

this would be the patch json:
```json
[
  {"op": "replace",
   "path": "/spec/rules/0/host",
   "value": "foo.bar.io"},

  {"op": "replace",
   "path": "/spec/rules/0/http/paths/0/backend/servicePort",
   "value": 80},

  {"op": "add",
   "path": "/spec/rules/0/http/paths/1",
   "value": { "path": "/healthz", "backend": {"servicePort":7700} }}
]
```
This would be the kustomize file
```yaml
resources:
- ingress.yaml
patches:
- path: ingress_patch.json
  target:
    group: networking.k8s.io
    version: v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    name: my-ingress
```
Out put would be 
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: homepage
          servicePort: 80
        path: /
      - backend:
          servicePort: 7700
        path: /healthz
      - backend:
          serviceName: my-api
          servicePort: 7701
        path: /api
      - backend:
          serviceName: hello
          servicePort: 7702
        path: /test
```

The path json file, it can be yaml file as well, but still need to follow json patch syntax 
```yaml
- op: add
  path: /spec/rules/0/http/paths/-
  value:
    path: '/canada'
    backend:
      serviceName: hoser
      servicePort: 7703
```

## Multiple patch 
You can apply patch to multiple file in on kustomize file. Each patch must associate with a target selector. 
e.g. 
```yaml
patches:
- path: <relative path to file containing patch>
  target:
    group: <optional group>
    version: <optional version>
    kind: <optional kind>
    name: <optional name>
    namespace: <optional namespace>
    labelSelector: <optional label selector>
    annotationSelector: <optional annotation selector>

```

Select resource match name 
```yaml
target:
  name: foo*
```

Select all resources of kind Deployment: 
```yaml
target:
  kind: Deployment
  
```

Use selector 
```yaml
target:
  kind: Deployment
  labelSelector: app=hello

```

## Strategic merge patch 

This merge patch is widely use in `kubectl apply ` , `kubectl edit` and `kubectl patch`. 

### Directives for merge
* replace
*  merge
 * delete
 * delete from primitive list
 
 ### replace 
 used on map this will replace all keys of map under the map follow by replace directive
 
```yaml
 $patch: replace  # recursive and applies to all fields of the map it's in
 containers:
 - name: nginx
   image: nginx-1.0
```
use on list of map, this wil only replace the list as `$patch: replace` is the component of list 
```yaml
 containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx-1.0
      - $patch: replace 
```
        
      
### Delete 
This patch will delete containers based on merge key
```yaml
containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx-1.0
  - $patch: delete
    name: log-tailer  # merge key and value goes here
```

Use on map
This will delete rolling update map 
```yaml
rollingUpdate:
  $patch: delete
  
```
This is equal to 
```yaml
rollingUpdate: null
```

### merge 
Simple, merge based on pre-defined merge key. 

### deleteFromPrimitiveList 
syntax:
```
$deleteFromPrimitiveList/<keyOfPrimitiveList>: [a primitive list] 
```

gave defined finalizer 
```yaml 
finalizers:
     - a
     - b
     - c
```
following directive will only delete b and c 
```yaml

# The directive includes the prefix $deleteFromPrimitiveList and
# followed by a '/' and the name of the list.
# The values in this list will be deleted after applying the patch.
$deleteFromPrimitiveList/finalizers:
  - b
  - c
```

### setElementOrder 
update the list order
```yaml
$setElementOrder/<keyOfList>: [a list]
```

### retainKeys 
```yaml
union:
  retainKeys:
    - another
    - bar
  another: d
  bar: c
```
