# Istio and Service Mash

## What is service mesh

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh

A service mesh is a infra layer for app communication but build right into app. A normal micro-services architecture 
without service mesh might become become too complex when app grow. 

It take the logic governing service-to-service communication out of individual services and abstract it to a layer of 
infrastructure. 

Service mesh use a "side car" along side micro-service in cluster. The side car proxy help micro-service and be decoupled 
from each services. This design would avoid code with logic to govern service-to-service communication. This will allow 
developer focus of business logic itself and provide visibility when things not working. 

### benifit
Why it optimise performance?
Provide visibility and metric tracking. 

### A service mesh compare (Linkerd vs Istio vs consul)
https://logz.io/blog/istio-linkerd-envoy-comparison-service-meshes/

Linkerd and Istio have a centralize control plane, but consul's control plane is a daemonset. All of these framework 
use a side car pattern for data plane. 

Istio is use [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) for this purpose, Linkerd is using [conduit](https://conduit.io/).
Istio have more traffic management function than linkerd. e.g. (circuit breakers, fault injection, retries, timeouts, routing rules, virtual servers, load balancing, and others. )

Linkerd is not supporting TCP & TLS, while istio and consul supporting both. Istio is specially strong at policy managment. 

For metric, Linkerd is providing grafana dashboard out of box, and istio is close integrate with (Kiali)[https://kiali.io/].

Consul take a unbiased approach and have integration with prometheus. 

For performance wise, Linkerd seams faster than istio as it don't have such a complicated policy management as istio has.
